# VowArc

**VowArc** is a high-integrity, voice-first AI coaching companion for ambitious professionals.  
It helps you turn a personal vow into a measurable 12-week outcome—while keeping your dignity intact.

**Tagline:** _VowArc: The Witness of Your Ambition_  
**Positioning:** _AI as the Eternal Witness to Your Resolve._

## Why VowArc

Modern life removed many external pressures—clans, guilds, strict communities—yet often replaced them with **freedom without purpose**.  
Without deadlines or a shared “cause,” even strong ambition can fade into distraction, loneliness, and quiet resignation.

VowArc exists to prove one thing:

> **People can change at any age—if their purpose is made concrete, witnessed over time, and translated into action.**

VowArc does not sell comfort. It offers **a disciplined relationship**: compassion first, then honest accountability—always within clear boundaries.

---

## What It Is

A **12-week (3-month) commitment program**, designed around:

- **Voice-first rituals** (daily check-ins that feel like a private ceremony)
- **Witness memory** (the AI remembers meaningfully—recent 7 days + key milestones)
- **Progress principle** (small wins and process metrics, especially in the first 21 days)
- **Integrity-based accountability** (tough love without humiliation; clear termination/refund protocol)

---

## Key Features (MVP)

### 1) Resonance Graph (Memory Visualization)

VowArc turns your words, values, obstacles, and turning points into a structured map—your “layers of memory.”

- Short-term memory: last 7 days (commitments, mood, obstacles, wins)
- Milestone memory: vows, values, anti-patterns, major promises, evidence of effort
- White-box memory: you can view/edit what the AI “remembers”

### 2) Voice-First Ritual (Daily Check-in)

Short morning/evening voice sessions designed for immersion and reflection.

- Minimal UI (no avatar) to keep attention inward
- Respectful silence, timing, and backchanneling (“aizuchi” / supportive cues)
- Summaries + next micro-commitment (If-Then plan)

### 3) The 21-Day Contract (Trial → Commitment)

The first 21 days are a structured trial to build trust and habits.  
Day 21 is not a paywall—it’s a **ritual of recommitment**.

- Evidence recap: what you actually did
- Small wins: where you didn’t quit
- Crystallized vow: how your “why” became concrete
- Forward projection: what’s likely in the next 9 weeks (with clear assumptions)
- Consent for tougher coaching: “May I challenge this anti-pattern more directly?”

### 4) High-Integrity Ending (Termination / Refund Protocol)

If repeated promise-breaking indicates the program isn’t working, VowArc may recommend stopping—**with a full refund**—as an act of integrity, not punishment.

This product is built to improve; early-stage losses are accepted to protect long-term trust.

## Who It’s For (MVP Target)

Primarily for **driven professionals (20s–30s)** who feel:

- materially “fine,” but spiritually underfed
- ready to change, but unable to sustain alone
- tired of shallow comfort; wanting real progress

---

## Philosophy

### Vision

**Unleashing individual potential, honoring mutual brilliance.**  
_A world where self-driven individuals freely unfold their unique potential and, with deep mutual respect, weave their brilliance together._

### Mission

**Evolve to prove what’s possible. Innovate Edtech to liberate the future.**

### Core Principles

- **Witness over hype:** your effort is recorded, structured, and reflected back to you.
- **Compassion → equality → tough love:** relationship evolves by phase, not mood.
- **No dependency design:** VowArc supports autonomy; it does not engineer emotional reliance.
- **Boundaries and safety:** not a medical tool; crisis situations are handled with safe guidance.

You can start developing by editing the files inside the app directory. This project uses file-based routing.

#### Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the app-example directory and create a blank app directory where you can start developing.
